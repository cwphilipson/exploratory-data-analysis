## Data Sources
Analyses performed herein were from UDACITY's "Data Analysis in R" course. Three separate analyses were performed on built in data from R (diamods dataset) or data provided by UDACITY (pseudo_facebook.tsv).

## Summary of Code
### Diamonds-P1.Rmd
This code uses the ggplot2 and dplyr packages to explore the Diamond prices dataset. A detailed description of the data is found here: http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/ggplot2/docs/diamonds. The code was developed in R Markdown format for reproducible figures derived from R code. The final output is visualized in the Diamonds-P1.html document.  
  
### Diamonds-P2.Rmd
This code is a continuation of the analysis from Diamonds-P1. The code uses the dplyr, ggplot2 and gridExtras packages to further explore the Diamond prices dataset. Coorelation between diamond features is explored. The final output can be visualized in the Diamonds-P2.html document.  
  
### Diamonds-P3.Rmd
This code builds on the previous two analyses and expands methods to futher characeterize the diamonds dataset. Additionally, pseudo_facebook.tsv data is explored to understand user behavior and friend initiation on social media.
